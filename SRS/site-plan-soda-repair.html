    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of my website is to reach those who can't fix an engine themselves and need help, and to also generate a high revenue at the same time with the website. </p>
    

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The target audience is anyone who owns a dirtbike that needs repairing, but will mainly be for younger to middle aged individuals. </p>\

    <h3>Overall Content</h3>
    <p>
      The main idea of creating this website is to help others understand why we offer our services and at such a good price as well. There are normally a lot of Dirt Bike shops, but the services we give are definitely worth the price and our goal is to help those who are in need of help the best we can and to the best of our abilities and being based out of Mount Hood Oregon there aren’t an insane amount of shops here. This site is to help the customer be able to receive that help as easily and as quickly as possible, that is why the site will be as simply laid out as possible. The simple layout and design of the website is to help the customer as much as possible and help them understand we care about questions and concerns and want them to reach out as quickly and easily as they can so that we can fix the problem easier as well. I think it is pertinent that the customer can reach out and have a quick way of doing that, and the site is meant to reflect that in its design.
      Why Contact our Support Team?
       We want to offer the best technical support and hands on support that we can and being able to do that through our website is the main goal always. When people visit our website we want it to feel immediately like things are going to get done and introduce the immediate feeling that they are in the right hands and can build trust with our shop.
       The questions our site will answer will help with making them more secure with choosing our shop. Many have the first question of whether or not we have a good staff which is answered immediately while talking with our front desk when calling and through the information we give on our employees. Many also have the question of how long it may take which is going to also be displayed on our website in the services tab. Those tabs that help will be located on the top bar of the website allowing for easy access. Easy access is what we are trying to get after, and to give people the answer to whatever questions might come across a customer's mind. All that is needed is the ability to click a button because that’s just how simple the layout will be while also offering an eye appealing look. Many think it isn’t possible to offer an appealing look while also giving a simple layout and ability to complete an action, but the goal is to allow for one to simply click to exactly where is needed and be provided all the information that is needed as well. We also like to provide information on how we came about and how the company was first started and why in Oregon.
      Contacting Customer Service
      The Soda Repair Shop site will allow the customer to schedule with us as simply as possible and be able to provide simple info as easily as possible too. Unlike many other moto shops, we value our customers' reviews and their input because that’s what makes our business better. We strive to push that through our website by including a that allows for anyone to share input or talk about their moto needs. By allowing for anyone to reach out we can talk directly with our customers and give them the direct care needed. We put the information right in front of you instead of making you look through multiple tabs and we always have someone ready to take the call for services. Our website is for the people and not against the people. We value our customers and that is why we have built a website to best suite the needs of our customers as well.
